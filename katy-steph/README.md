# Lab 07: NodeJS & NPM

**Author**: Stephen Harper and Katy Bowers
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
The application is a working blog. We are building it so the user can derive info from a server. And create new blog posts for other guests to retrieve. Also to be able to see if any errors were made if a different URL was accessed.

## Getting Started
A computer. A browser (Chrome preferred). node. Express.js. Terminal or commandprompt. VS Code. 

## Architecture
For application design, we used html, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, node.js, express.js, JSON. Google fonts. Handlebars.js.

## Change Log
04-18-2018 11:35am - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.
